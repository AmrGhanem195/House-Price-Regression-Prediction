Notebook

The Jupyter notebook included in this repository contains the following sections:

Data exploration: This section explores the data using various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
Data preprocessing: This section preprocesses the data by removing outliers, encoding categorical variables, and scaling numerical variables.
Data visualization: This section visualizes the preprocessed data using various visualizations, including histograms, scatter plots, and boxplots.
Results

The results of the data analysis show that there are several factors that are correlated with sale price, including square footage, number of bedrooms, and number of bathrooms. The results also show that there is a strong relationship between the age of the house and the sale price.

Conclusion

This notebook demonstrates how to use Python libraries to analyze the House Prices dataset. The results of the data analysis show that there are several factors that are correlated with sale price. This information can be used to inform decision-making about the purchase or sale of a house.
